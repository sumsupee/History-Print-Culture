			<h2>Print culture-its origin!</h2>
			<p>The earliest kind of print technology was developed in China, Japan
and Korea. This was a system of hand printing. From AD 594
onwards, books in China were printed by rubbing paper - also
invented there - against the inked surface of woodblocks. As both
sides of the thin, porous sheet could not be printed, the traditional
Chinese 'accordion book' was folded and stitched at the side.

			<p>Buddhist missionaries from China introduced hand-printing
technology into Japan around AD 768-770. The oldest Japanese book,
printed in AD 868, is the Buddhist Diamond Sutra, containing six sheets
of text and woodcut illustrations. Pictures were printed on textiles,

Calligraphy - The art of beautiful and stylised
writing, 
playing cards and paper money. In medieval Japan, poets and
prose writers were regularly published, and books were cheap
and abundant.
Printing of visual material led to interesting publishing practices. In
the late eighteenth century, in the flourishing urban circles at Edo
(later to be known as Tokyo), illustrated collections of paintings
depicted an elegant urban culture, involving artists, courtesans, and
teahouse gatherings. Libraries and bookstores were packed with
hand-printed material of various types - books on women, musical
instruments, calculations, tea ceremony, flower arrangements, proper
etiquette, cooking and famous places.

		<h3>More to know!</h3>

				<span>Kitagawa Utamaro</span>, born in Edo in 1753, was widely known for
his contributions to an art form called ukiyo ('pictures of the floating
world') or depiction of ordinary human experiences, especially urban
ones. These prints travelled to contemporary US and Europe and
influenced artists like Manet, Monet and Van Gogh. Publishers like
Tsutaya Juzaburo identified subjects and commissioned artists who
drew the theme in outline. Then a skilled woodblock carver pasted
the drawing on a woodblock and carved a printing block to
reproduce the painter's lines. In the process, the original drawing
would be destroyed and only prints would survive.
